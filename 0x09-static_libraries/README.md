Project work on 0x09. C static libraries Creating a C Static library

Generally we learnt the following: 

What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm

Task_0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
> Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed below:

> If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the
right prototype.

> Don’t forget to push your main.h file to your repository. It should at least
contain all the prototypes of the above functions.

Task_1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
> Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library
called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
